Survey Form RWB project
(Responsive Web Design)

Hi!

Thank you for stopping by!

This project is part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design's curriculum. 

The task was to create a survey form that had to have certain elements, but also give it a little bit of personality. 
As I recently finished Matt Haig's "Midnight Library" - a book that can be classed as psycological fiction about life choices- it dawned on me that libraries offer services, and how better to keep track of the people's satisfaction, than with a survey?
